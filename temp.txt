The instructions/packages on the MongoDB site are currently available for LTS Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 only. The packages are set up to use upstart instead of systemd. You need to create a systemctl file to be ready for systemd. Create it by

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mongodb.service
It will look like

[Unit]
Description=High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database
After=network.target

[Service]
User=mongodb
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --quiet --config /etc/mongod.conf

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Now you can start the service and check its state by

sudo systemctl start mongodb
sudo systemctl status mongodb
and finally enable it permanently by

sudo systemctl enable mongodb

Step 3 â€” Adjusting the Firewall (Optional)
Assuming you have followed the initial server setup tutorial instructions to enable the firewall on your server, MongoDB server will be inaccessible from the internet.

If you intend to use the MongoDB server only locally with applications running on the same server, it is a recommended and secure setting. However, if you would like to be able to connect to your MongoDB server from the internet, we have to allow the incoming connections in ufw.

To allow access to MongoDB on its default port 27017 from everywhere, you could use sudo ufw allow 27017. However, enabling internet access to MongoDB server on a default installation gives unrestricted access to the whole database server.

in most cases, MongoDB should be accessed only from certain trusted locations, such as another server hosting an application. To accomplish this task, you can allow access on MongoDB's default port while specifying the IP address of another server that will be explicitly allowed to connect.

sudo ufw allow from your_other_server_ip/32 to any port 27017
You can verify the change in firewall settings with ufw.

sudo ufw status
